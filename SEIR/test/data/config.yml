## This config file will not generate a makefile as currently configured.
## We want to show all of the options available, even though some are not appropriately general for this scope
## In particular, importation and the associated FolderDraw seeding method only work for sets of US states.
## The comments in this file explain how to modify it based on your use case
## Items that must be changed for the process to work are designated by < >.
## Some items in the config can be removed, and we have tried to note these with comments as well.
